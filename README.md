# House Price Prediction

This project focuses on predicting house prices using both machine learning (Linear Regression) and deep learning (Neural Network) techniques. Additionally, a user-friendly GUI is developed to interact with the prediction models.

# Data Preprocessing

1. Dataset Overview:
   The dataset is analyzed to understand its structure and content.

2. Cleaning:
   Irrelevant columns (e.g., date, address) are removed, and rows with missing values are dropped.

3. Feature Preparation:
   The data is split into features (input variables) and the target (house prices). Numerical features are standardized, and categorical features are 
   one- hot encoded.

# Model Training

1. Data Splitting:
   The data is divided into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.

2. Linear Regression:
   A Linear Regression model is trained to establish a linear relationship between features and prices.

3. Neural Network:
   A deep learning model is trained using a neural network with multiple layers to predict house prices.

# Model Evaluation

1. Linear Regression:
   The model's performance is evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R²).

2. Neural Network:
   The neural network's training progress is monitored, focusing on loss reduction over iterations.

# GUI Development

1. Interface Design:
   A graphical user interface (GUI) is created to allow users to input house features and obtain price predictions.

2. User Interaction:
   The GUI takes user input for various house features, processes the data, and provides predictions using the trained models.

3. Integration:
   The GUI is integrated with the underlying models, ensuring seamless interaction and real-time price prediction.

# Conclusion
This project demonstrates two approaches—Linear Regression and Neural Networks—for predicting house prices and includes a user-friendly GUI to interact with the models.
